# Hate-speech-checker
As we know social media has become a large platform to share information via post with others. But, sometimes people often spread false and hate content on social media, Which lead to big riots in country. So, as a part of our course "privacy in online social media " course by pk sir. We have created a tool by which we can check that whether the given tweet contain some hate content or not, for now this tool only works for twitter but can extended for other platform also. To create this tool we have used Django framework in python and machine learning model.
In order to run this project you have to install Django or create the environment.
Then run the following command "python manage.py runserver".
This will open the tab in your browser with localhost running.
There you will see the interface.
There you can put the link of the tweet which you want to analyse and then click on submit.
In result,this will classify the tweet as "HATE" or "NOT HATE".
